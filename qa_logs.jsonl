These plates are constantly, albeit very slowly, moving across the Earth's surface, driven by convection currents in the molten mantle beneath them.\n\n2.  **Plate Boundaries:** Earthquakes most commonly occur at the boundaries where these plates interact. There are three main types of plate boundaries:\n    *   **Convergent Boundaries:** Plates collide or one slides beneath another (subduction).\n    *   **Divergent Boundaries:** Plates pull apart from each other.\n    *   **Transform Boundaries:** Plates slide past each other horizontally.\n\n3.  **Friction and Stress Buildup:** As the plates move, they don't slide smoothly past each other. The irregular surfaces of the rocks at the plate boundaries get stuck due to immense friction. Despite being \"stuck,\" the driving forces from the mantle continue to push or pull the plates. This causes enormous amounts of stress and strain to build up in the rocks along the boundary (which are called **faults**).\n\n4.  **Sudden Slip and Energy Release:** Eventually, the stress along the fault becomes so great that it overcomes the friction holding the rocks together. The rocks suddenly \"snap\" or \"slip\" past each other. This sudden movement releases a tremendous amount of stored energy in the form of **seismic waves**.\n\n5.  **Seismic Waves and Ground Shaking:** These seismic waves travel through the Earth's crust, causing the ground to shake. The point where the rupture originates underground is called the **focus** (or hypocenter), and the point directly above it on the Earth's surface is called the **epicenter**.\n\n**Other, Less Common Causes of Earthquakes (Induced Seismicity):**\n\nWhile tectonic plate movement is the primary cause, some earthquakes can also be triggered by:\n\n*   **Volcanic Activity:** Movement of magma beneath a volcano can create stresses that cause small earthquakes.\n*   **Human Activities (Induced Seismicity):**\n    *   **Fracking:** Injecting fluid into the ground to extract oil and gas can lubricate existing faults or increase pore pressure, triggering earthquakes.\n    *   **Reservoir-induced seismicity:** The weight of water in large reservoirs behind dams can stress the crust, and the water seeping into the ground can lubricate faults.\n    *   **Geothermal energy production:** Injecting water into hot rocks to generate steam can also induce seismic activity.\n    *   **Mining:** Large underground excavations or collapses can cause localized tremors.\n    *   **Underground nuclear tests:** These can create their own seismic waves.\n*   **Meteorite Impacts:** Very large impacts can cause seismic shaking, though this is an extremely rare cause of significant earthquakes in modern times.\n\nIn summary, the Earth's dynamic, moving plates are the fundamental reason for most earthquakes, as the friction and subsequent sudden release of built-up stress along their boundaries cause the ground to shake.", "model": "models/gemini-2.5-flash", "temperature": 0.7}
