Colors are properties of light and our visual perception, while numbers are abstract mathematical concepts.\n\nHowever, there is a fascinating phenomenon known as \"numerus color\" or \"color semantics,\" which suggests that certain numerical values might be linked to specific colors in people's minds. This connection can vary across cultures and individuals.\n\nIn the case of the number 7, some research has found that people often associate it with the color green (e.g., [1]). This might be due to various factors, such as:\n\n1. Linguistic associations: In many languages, including English, words related to completeness or perfection are linked to the number 7 and the color green.\n2. Cultural influences: In some cultures, like ancient Greece and Rome, seven was considered a sacred number with mystical properties, which might have been represented by green as a symbol of growth, harmony, and balance.\n3. Aesthetics: The color green is often perceived as calming, balanced, and harmonious, which could align with the sense of completion or fulfillment that people might associate with the number 7.\n\nIt's essential to note that these connections are subjective and not universally accepted. People's associations between numbers and colors can vary greatly, and there is no objective \"correct\" answer.\n\nIn summary, while there might be some cultural or linguistic connections between the number 7 and the color green, it is not a universally established link. Numbers do not inherently have hues, but our perceptions and associations with them can be influenced by various factors.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Zuber-Skerritt, O., & Long, M. (2018).
